# D&D Character Creator

**D&D Character Creator** is a handy character creation app based on the 5th Edition handbook of Dungeons & Dragons. It allows you to create multiple characters and keep track of their stat changes as they progress in their adventures.

An older version of this app is currently live on [Heroku](https://fathomless-forest-59120.herokuapp.com/). It is not yet optimized for mobile use.

## Basic Use

- Create a user account.
- At the user profile page, click the 'Create character' link.
- Fill out all required fields and click the 'Create' button.
- View a list of all of your characters on the user profile page.
- Click on a character's name to view their stats and other information.
- Use the arrow buttons next to each stat to update the character's information as you progress in your campaign.
